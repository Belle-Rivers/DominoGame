# 🎲 Domino Game – Artificial Intelligence Research Project

## Project Synopsis

This project was developed as part of an **Artificial Intelligence** course and focuses on the theoretical and practical foundations behind the **Domino game** from an AI perspective. The project explores how the game operates, its internal data structures, and how it can be modeled within a **multi-agent environment**.

Rather than implementing a full playable game with performance optimization as the main objective, the project emphasizes **research, analysis, and understanding** of how classical AI concepts apply to board games. Key topics include search problems in computer games, the algorithms commonly used in Domino-based environments, and the role of heuristic functions in designing intelligent gaming agents.

Through this research-based approach, the project highlights how Python can be effectively used to represent game states, agents, and search strategies within artificial intelligence systems.



## Project Goal

To study and document the application of **search algorithms, heuristics, and multi-agent concepts** in the context of the Domino game.



## Topics Covered

This project discusses and analyzes the following concepts:

- How the Domino game works
- Game state representation and data structures
- Multi-agent environments in board games
- Search problems in computer games
- Algorithms used in Domino-related problems
- Heuristic functions in gaming agents
