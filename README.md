# DominoGame
A research project about Domino game that discussed how does the game work, its data structure, the multi-agent environment, search problems in computer games, the algorithms used in Domino, and the heuristic functions in gaming agents. 

Check this [introductory video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1J3r-a1ZMZ-oi-1F20_K_V7jUno4UGOfQ/view?usp=sharing) about the Domino Game project.

Check the "DominoGame_Report" file to see all the information and resources I collected during my studies for this assignment. 

The main language used for this project was **Python** since the course was **Artifical Intelligence** and we were exploring the power of python in searching algorithms.
